# Polkadot introspector

The introspector is a collection of tools for monitoring and introspection of the Polkadot
or other substrate based blockchains via a set of tools (for example, subxt). Depending on
the tool, the data source and output might differ. For examples of how this data can be
visualised in Grafana, please see the Grafana dashboards section.
